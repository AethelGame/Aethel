## Information

Since this is early on in development, there is a lot of things missing. I have a lot of plans, since this is an early "concept".
- Design most of the states, add settings configuration, add skin/HUD editor.
- Setup audio management using BASS

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> Detailed instructions will come later, good luck to anyone trying this out.

To get the repository, you need to clone it with --recurse-submodules.
There are .bat files in the /tools folder to get it loaded up on Windows, but you do need `CMake` for it. I recommend using [w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit)!

## Dependencies

This project uses `GLFW`, `GLM`, and `freetype` as its dependencies through submodules. It also uses [BASS](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html) and [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) with OpenGL 4.6 as dependencies outside of it.
